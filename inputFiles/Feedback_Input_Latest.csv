Stupid face scan!,1
The verification required is ridiculous. Once done it works well enough.,2
Fail to connect to bank account,4
"Useless app. Cannot recognise a face at all, but it CAN give you patronising instructions about putting your eyes inside the circles as if it was challenging. I'm not doing it wrong.... Your app is terrible!",1
Garbage app that keeps getting worse. My partner's PayMe got hacked so he contacted support to inform them and they told him to uninstall & reinstall the app to solve the problem. Absolutely useless.,1
Slow and not user friendly,2
Why did you change the interface to pay business as the primary button? Paying friends is my priority this is the point for payme as a p2p transaction.,2
there is fatal error and my money is held without my authorization,1
Very Efficient,4
Very bad experience logging in. Tried so many times for face scan verification and failed.,1
"Doesn't allow to pay only with consumer voucher, the pop-up keep hiding the QR code to pay business",1
Does it work? Open the App and stays at the entry picture but does not enter into application.,1
Can't scan my ID card. Keep fail,1
User friendly.,5
